Towards Stability for Deep LEarning via TDA.

Code and results obtained during an Internship in Stockholm (SE). March-June 2024.

TORUS_PERSISTENCE.IPYNB

In this notebook geometrical features extracted from a point cloud on the surface of a torus without and with perturbation are inspected.

Alpha complexes and corresponding Persistent Diagram are computed, leading to the stable rank transformation.

ORBIT5KCLOUDS.IPYNB

Benchmark dataset used in TDA.

Visualization of point clouds it is composed of.

TRAININGLINF.IPYNB

Generation of ORBIT5K dataset with reduceed test set.

Iniziatlization and training of an L_inf Network applied on stable ranks.
